# Frontend test

To test your skills with frontend development I attached an image that represent the login screen of our next top success app.

For now we want that fully functional "Login screen" and some navigation to the "Need help screen" and the "Forgot password screen". And, as you can see, those two last screens I mentioned do not have layout yet, so you can use your creativity go get those done based on the provided style.

I recommend you to use this setup: React + Webpack + Typescript + Semantic UI. But feel free to take the risk of using a different setup, but don't forget to justify your decision.

This test is suppose to take from 30 to 60 minutes.  So... take note of our mantra:
- ~~Strike first, Strike hard, No mercy!... Ops, not this one...~~
- **A short path, Keep it simple, Code cleaner!**

## Tasklist

An small tasklist to help you to remember:
- Project setup/scaffold
- Login screen
- Error message for invalid credentials
- Need help screen (https://www.lipsum.com/feed/html)
- Forgot password screen
- Push to Github (with dist/ commited)

Please do not take more than 1 hour building this, just send us what you have completed with a note!
